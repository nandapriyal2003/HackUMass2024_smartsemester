# Smart Semester

Smart Semester is an AI-powered scheduling solution designed to address inefficiencies in educational scheduling. This hackathon prototype demonstrates a simplified version of class scheduling, midterm conflict checking, and user authentication.

## Features
- Dynamic class scheduling with time optimization between classes.
- Midterm conflict checker to avoid overlapping exams.
- Simplified login system for demonstration purposes.

## Project Structure
- `backend/`: Contains the Flask backend files.
- `frontend/`: Contains the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript frontend files.
- `docs/`: Contains project roadmap and other documentation.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Flask (`pip install flask`)

### Backend Setup
1. Navigate to the `backend` directory:
   
2. Install dependencies:
 
3. Initialize the database (run `db_setup.py` if database structure changes are needed):
  
4. Run the server:
   

### Frontend Setup
Simply open the `frontend/index.html` file in your browser to access the app.

## Usage
- The frontend interacts with the backend to fetch schedules and midterm conflicts.
- Users can view a simplified schedule and midterm conflict information.

## Roadmap
See `docs/roadmap.md` for future plans and scalability.
